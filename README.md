# Typst Notes For Patrick

## Useful Things:
1. The shortcut for commenting something out (so you can do things like \"disable\" sections of formatting, to see what's causing what)\
  Mac: select text; <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>\
  Windows/Linux: select text; <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> (I think - let me know if it doesn't work!)
1. You. (I didn't have a second list item at the time of writing.)
